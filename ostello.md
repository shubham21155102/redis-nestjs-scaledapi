# Ostello Mobile App Bugs

- During opening of app it is taking time
- For Institutes listing we can use local storage instead of fetching server each times also keeping caches to the server
- images that is available on app is taking more data to load we can compress that intead of loading images multiple times we can store it also to the local storage of user
- on confirming the current location activity page is not responding
- on clicking ny institute it is taking more time as usual we can use local store here also for this
- As i can see there is no any lazy loading implemented by virtue of which whole app page is trying to load the same page's all content at the same instant we can reduce it by lazy loading
